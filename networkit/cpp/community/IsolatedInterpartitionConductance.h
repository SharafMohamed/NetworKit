/**
 * Isolated inter-partition conductance is a measure for how well a partition
 * (communtiy/cluster) is separated from the rest of the graph.
 *
 * The conductance of a partition is defined as the weight of the cut divided
 * by the volume (the sum of the degrees) of the nodes in the partition or the
 * nodes in the rest of the graph, whatever is smaller. Small values thus indicate
 * that the cut is small compared to the volume of the smaller of the separated
 * parts. For the whole partitions usually the maximum or the unweighted average
 * is used.
 *
 * See also Experiments on Density-Constrained Graph Clustering,
 * Robert GÃ¶rke, Andrea Kappes and  Dorothea Wagner, JEA 2015:
 * http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2638551
