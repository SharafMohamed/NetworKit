      "## Determining Important Nodes\n",
      "There are a number of ways to measure the importance of nodes in a network. Possibly the easiest is the degree, i.e. the number of neighbors. In a social network, for example, a person who knows many others could be an important person. However, is this notion really meaningful? Probably not, since it does not consider the importance of the neighbors. Also, there is an interesting effect in social networks with respect to neighborhood sizes. Let us investigate this effect a little bit:\n",

      "Thus, **... % of the users in this network have fewer friends than their friends have on average**. While this result cannot be generalized exactly like this to other networks, the qualitative effect is often seen in social (and other) networks.
