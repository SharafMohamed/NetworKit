December 13, 2016: **NetworKit 4.2 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Today we announce the next version of NetworKit, the open-source toolkit for large-scale network analysis. NetworKit is a Python package, with performance-critical algorithms implemented in C++/OpenMP.

**Release notes**

Major:

- New graph drawing algorithm for the Maxent-stress model; the algorithm can layout even large graphs quickly. It follows the paper by Gansner et al. with some modifications; the biggest deviation is the use of the LAMG solver for the Laplacian linear systems
- Parallel implementation for the approximation of the neighborhood function; class has been refactored from ApproxNeighborhoodFunction to NeighborhoodFunctionApproximation.
- New heuristic algorithm for the neighborhood function. It is based on sampling and the breadth-first search and offers more flexibility with regards to the tradeoff between running time and accuracy as the number of samples can be specified by the user. It is also much faster than the approximation algorithm for networks with a high diameter (e.g. road networks).
    
Minor:

- Iterative implementation of components.StronglyConnectedComponents, which is now the new default. For graphs where edges have been deleted, it is recommended to use the recursive implementation, which is still available.
- Removed heuristic for vertex diameter estimation from centrality.ApproxBetweenness (now the vertex diameter is estimated as suggested in Riondato, Kornaropoulos: Fast approximation of betweenness centrality through sampling)
- Refactoring of the approximation algorithms in the distance group. ApproxNAME -> NAMEApproximation.
- Simplified installation procedure: Install required dependencies automatically

July 06, 2016: **Publication accepted at CSC 2016**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our paper on approximating current-flow closeness centrality using NetworKit (authors: Bergamini, Wegner, Lukarski, Meyerhenke) has been accepted for publication at the 7th SIAM Workshop on Combinatorial Scientific Computing (CSC16). |br| |br|


July 05, 2016: **NetworKit 4.1.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a more of a maintenance release, that fixes the pip package and building with clang is possible again (at least with version 3.8).

Note: You can control which C++ compiler the setup.py of the networkit package is supposed to use with e.g. :code:`CXX=clang++ pip install networkit`. This may be helpful when the setup fails to detect the compiler.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have released version 3.6 today. Thank you to all contributors. Here are the release notes.

*Release Notes*

Major Updates:

Link Prediction

Link prediction methods try to predict the likelihood of a future or missing connection between two nodes in a given network. The new module networkit.linkprediction contains various methods from the literature.

Edge Sparsification

Sparsification reduces the size of networks while preserving structural and statistical properties of interest. The module networkit.sparsification provides methods for rating edges by importance and then filtering globally by these scores. The methods are described in http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00564


Further Updates:

- Improved support for directed graph in analysis algorithms
- Improved support for the Intel compiler
- Reader/writer for the GEXF (Gephi) graph file format
